<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Want to Learn AI: Here Are Google’s Free Generative AI Courses to Transform Your Skills!</h4>



<p>If you have been following me, you might be aware that the CEO of Google DeepMind recently stated that we could see some form of Artificial General Intelligence AGI in the next few years. It may sound unbelievable, but there are numerous companies actively working towards this goal.<br><br>Even governments worldwide have shown a keen interest in advancing AI technology. For instance, Japan has recently announced that will not enforce copyrights on data used in AI training, signaling their ambition to become a leader in the field. Currently, there are 6 courses available for you to explore. Here is the list of courses:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Introduction to Generative AI</h4>



<p>The first course on the list is an introductory course that aims to give learners a solid understanding of Generative AI. In this course, you will learn the basics of what Generative AI is, how it is applied in various fields, and how it sets itself apart from traditional machine learning methods.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Introduction to Large Language Models</h4>



<p>If you’ve been using ChatGPT, you might be familiar with the term “LLMs” or Large Language Models, which serve as the foundation for building AI applications. This course focuses on precisely that.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Introduction to Responsible AI</h4>



<p>The third course on the list focuses on Responsible AI, providing an introductory-level exploration of what it entails and why it is important. In this course, you will learn about the principles and practices of responsible AI.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>Throughout the course, you&#8217;ll delve into the intricacies of encoder and decoder components, as well as other essential components that make up an image captioning model.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Introduction to Image Generation</h4>



<p>Many of us were amazed by the image-generation tools like Midjourney that emerged after the launch of ChatGPT. These tools have the incredible ability to create realistic images using only text prompts. Even the OpenAI API can assist in generating images.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Encoder-Decoder Architecture</h4>



<p>When using Bard or ChatGPT, you may have noticed that these AI models often provide accurate responses. To achieve this, the Google and OpenAI teams integrate vast amounts of data to improve prediction accuracy.</p>
